    The Timer is designed for precisely measuring time elapsed.
    The Timer contains two registers: a & b.
    
    Since time is read as a 16-bit value in ms, times above 65s cannot be read
    by default. Time elapsed is effectively divided by b to result in the final
    reading, so longer times can be measured by reducing accuracy.
    
    The Timer should always be intialised by writing to a before first read.
    
    a:
        - write anything here to start the timer.
        - read time elapsed since the last write to a (low byte).
        
    b:
        - write to set milliseconds per 1 unit in time readout
        - read time elapsed since the last write to a (high byte)
