## Addressing Modes

This is a list of the addressing modes that I have completed, and the ones that
I have left to complete.

- [x] Implicit (represented as `None`)
- [x] Accumulator

For the accumulator addressing mode, because the fetch functions do not
explicitly take a `byte`, but an `int` (Python has no `byte` type), I created a
special memory address outside of the normal addressing range so that nothing
can interfere with it: `-0xacc`. This address will be returned by
`addr_accumulator` and when fetched or written to by the cpu, the accumulator
itself will be accessed.

- [x] Immediate
- [x] Zero Page
- [x] Zero Page,X
